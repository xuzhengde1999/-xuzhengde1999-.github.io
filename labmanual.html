   <h2><a id="office-time" class="anchor" href="#publications" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Working time</h2>
<p>Being in lab is a good way of learning from others, helping others, building camaraderie, having fast and easy access to resources (and people) you need, and being relatively free from distractions at home (e.g., your bed). That said, hours in academia are more flexible than other jobs -- but you should still treat it as a real job and show up to the lab. My primary concern is that you get your work done. <br><br>

If you think there is anything disturbing your research, or you want to make some suggestions for the laboratory, please contact Jingwei or PI.	
	
To encourage lab interaction, try to be in most weekdays during ‘peak’ hours (assuming no other obligations) – e.g., between 10am and 5pm. <br><br>

p.s. Playing games in the lab is NOT allowed and pls report to me if you have vacation plan.    .

  <h2><a id="office-time" class="anchor" href="#publications" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lab Rules</h2>
	<p>No games in lab<br>

   <h2><a id="authorship" class="anchor" href="#publications" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authorship</h2>
<p>Like other labs, we will follow the APA guidelines with respect to authorship: <br><br>
<i>"Authorship credit should reflect the individual's contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published." </i><br><br>
At the start of a new project, the student or post-doc taking on the lead role can expect to be first author (talk to Zhifeng about it if you aren’t sure). Zhifeng will typically be the last author, unless the project is primarily under the guidance of another PI and Zhifeng is involved as a secondary PI – then Zhifeng will be second to last and the main PI will be last. Students and post-docs who help over the course of the project may be added to the author list depending on their contribution, and their placement will be discussed with all parties involved in the paper. If a student or post-doc takes on a project but subsequently hands it off to another student or post-doc, they will most likely lose first-authorship to that student or post-doc, unless co-first-authorship is appropriate. All of these issues will be discussed openly, and you should feel free to bring them up if you are not sure of your authorship status or want to challenge it.

   <h2><a id="Personal Intergrity" class="anchor" href="#publications" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Moral</h2>
<p>Lab members should conduct themselves with honesty and propriety, and perform their duties in a professional and conscientious manner. Examples of dishonest and unacceptable conduct include, but are not limited to, the following: stealing, cheating, lying about work-related matters; plagiarism; falsifying records; unauthorized personal use of Lab property; unauthorized use of Lab confidential information; doing unauthorized private work on University time; and giving or receiving a bribe in any form.

	<p>Target on the student cultivation<br>Throughout your Master or PhD study, it is not important how many papers you have published. More important is your personal growth. When you can complete the following tasks, in my view, you have satisfied the requirement of Master degree.<br>1. Make the decision by yourself <br>2. Complete writing the paper on your own <br>3. Complete the rebuttal on your own
